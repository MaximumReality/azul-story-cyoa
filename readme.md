# 🐱🐈‍⬛ Chat with Azul & Mochkil  
### An Interactive Maximum Reality Story Experience

Welcome to **Maximum Reality**, where *you* create the prompt —  
and **Azul 🧪** and **Mochkil 🍪** decide how the story ends.

This project is not a chatbot.  
It’s an **interactive story gateway** that makes visitors feel like they created the adventure themselves.

Type a prompt, watch the characters react, and sometimes…  
your idea unlocks a short animated video ending.

## 🎬 Story Endings Included

Each video represents a different “story ending” inside Maximum Reality:

- 🏴‍☠️ **Pirates Adventure** — sea shanties, cardboard ships, and make-believe mayhem  
- 🥷 **Ninja Farm** — boredom, karate chops, and a very confused sheep  
- 🚀 **Space Voyager** — a cardboard box becomes a spaceship  
- 🌮 **Taco Truck (Spanish)** — imagination turns a box into a colorful taquería  
- 🌿 **New Zealand Adventure** — mountains, streams, kiwi birds, and peaceful exploration  
- 🌙 **Mochkil’s Sweet Dream** — cozy chaos in dreamland  
- 💻 **Azul & Lori Hack the Scammers** — Maximum Reality justice, hacker style  

Videos are short, playful, and designed to feel like **the ending to a story the viewer imagined**.

## 🐱 Characters

### Azul 🧪  
A calm, floating, bioluminescent sphynx cat who understands the hidden rules of Maximum Reality.  
Patient. Observant. Slightly cosmic. Often hacking reality itself.

### Mochkil 🍪  
A tuxedo kitten rescued from the marina in **Essaouira, Morocco**.  
1000% food-driven. Oblivious to danger. Speaks in a childish voice and fluent Gen-Z slang.  
His best friend Azul puts up with his chaos… somehow.
